    <h2>The Long Road to Competence</h2>
    <p>
      My journey in tech didn’t start with brilliance. It started with confusion.
      Broken environments. StackOverflow tabs. The humbling realization that I
      didn’t know nearly as much as I thought I did.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, something changed. I stopped trying to be impressive and
      started trying to understand. That shift made all the difference.
    </p>

    <h2>Systems Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it's cloud architecture or personal habits, everything is a
      system. Inputs, outputs, feedback loops. Improve the system and the
      results follow.
    </p>

    <h2>Staying Curious</h2>
    <p>
      The best engineers I’ve met aren’t the loudest. They’re the most curious.
      They ask better questions. They iterate faster. They treat mistakes as
      data.
